"""Grease entities are useful as actionable, interactive
game elements that are often visible to the player.

You might use entities to represent:

- Characters
- Bullets
- Particles
- Pick-ups
- Space Ships
- Weapons
- Trees
- Planets
- Explosions

See :ref:`an example entity class in the tutorial <tut-entity-example>`.
